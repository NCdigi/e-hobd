      "authorNote": "His glory is so great that sinful man cannot look on His presence and live. Yet He reveals Himself to us in other ways.\n\n\t\"The revelation of Himself that God has given in His word is for our study. This we may seek to understand. But beyond this we are not to penetrate. The highest intellect may tax itself until it is wearied out in conjectures regarding the nature of God; but the effort will be fruitless. This problem has not been given to us to solve. No human mind can comprehend God. Let not finite man attempt to interpret Him. Let none indulge in speculation regarding His nature. Here silence is eloquent. The Omniscient One is above discussion.\"  â€” E.G. White, Testimonies to the Church Vol. 8, p. 279\n\n\t\"As we learn more and more of what God is, and of what we ourselves are in His sight, we shall fear and tremble before Him.\" - E.G. White, Testimonies to the Church Vol. 8, p. 283"
