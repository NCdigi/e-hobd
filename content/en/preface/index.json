"content": "This handbook of Bible doctrines as taught by the Seventh-day Adventist church is not fundamentally a new book, but rather an adaptation of the already existing handbooks.\n\n __The key areas to note are:__\n  1. The title: We have entitled it a \\\"handbook\\\" and not a \\\"manual\\\" as indicated on earlier versions, the reason being that the church believes we do not require so many \\\"manuals\\\" as we already have one, namely, \\\"The Seventh-day Adventist Church Manual\\\".\n\n  2. At the beginning of each lesson, we have added a summary statement of the Seventh-day Adventist Beliefs.\n  3. We have recaptured some key Spirit of Prophecy statements dealing directly with each particular subject. These are not exhausitive in nature but they help to provide focus for in-depth learning as we uphold the Bible teachings and insights from the writings of Ellen G. White.\n\n It is our prayer that as you grow through these lessons, you will also grow in knowing and loving the Man of Calvary and at the same time become a truly committed member of His remnant church, the Seventh-day Adventist Church.\n\n Yours in the Blessed Hope,\n\n   <table>\n  <tr>\n    <td colspan=\"1\">\n      Passmore N.
