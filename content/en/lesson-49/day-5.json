One's **total increase** (including that on our gardens, flocks, crops, salaries, etc.) must be divided by ten. Then one full tenth must be returned to God, otherwise it is not a tithe. Many Christians try to lie to God when they offer coins to Him, when such is not their real tithe. These coins are merely an offering if they are not a true tenth of oneâ€™s increase. By doing this, many fail to receive the promised blessings"
