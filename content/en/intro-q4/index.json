  "title": "Introduction to the Fourth Quarter's Lessons",
  "content": "God has placed spiritual gifts in His Church, and through them its members are to be built up, edified, and strengthened. The special work of God’s people is to represent Him in a wicked world. As Jesus thought of His precious children and their places amongst men, He said, “You are the light of the world.” (Matthew 5:14).\n   The apostle Peter knew what it meant to experience the blessings of the gospel and was inspired to write, \\“...you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people, that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvellous light\\” (1 Peter 2:9)\n   God does not promise that we will always have an easy, untroubled life. In fact, He has promised some difficulties: \\“...all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution\\” (2 Timothy 3:12). But we are to rest assured that we need never feel alone for He says also, \\“... I am with you always, even unto the end of the age\\” (Matthew 28:20).\n   Study the lessons for this quarter diligently and let the truths they contain be established in your life. Thus you will be an overcomer and will enjoy the promises made to the overcomers who reach the better world."
