"fundamentalBelief": "STATEMENT FROM THE PEN OF INSPIRATION\n“If we are desirous of understanding the law of earthly governments, how much more should we desire to know what God requires of us. If we are anxious to understand our duty, he will not leave us to be enshrouded in darkness but will enlighten our understanding so that we shall know for ourselves what is truth.” (ST April 22, 1889)\n\n“Those who occupy the highest positions in governments reveal how little confidence God can place in their rulership.” (3MR 42)\n\n“The government under which Jesus lived was corrupt and oppressive. On every hand were crying abuses – extortion, intolerance, and grinding cruelty. Yet the Saviour attempted no civil reforms, attacked no national abuses, nor condemned the national enemies. He did not interfere with the authority of those in power. He who was our example kept aloof from earthly governments; not because He was indifferent to the woes of men, but because the remedy did not lie in merely human and external measures. The cure must regenerate the heart.” (HLv 341)\n",
