      "authorNote": "Forty people had a part in writing this Book. They lived over a period of fifteen hundred years.\n\"The authorship of this book is wonderful. Here are words written by kings, by emperors, by princes, by poets, by sages, by philosophers, by fishermen, by statesmen, by men learned in the wisdom of Egypt, educated in the schools of Babylon, trained at the feet of rabbis in Jerusalem. It was written by men in exile, in the deserts, in shepherds'tents, in green pastures, and beside still waters. Among its authors we find the exiles, captains, legislators, judges; men of every grade and class are represented in this wonderful volume...It contains all kinds of writings; but what a jumble it would be if sixty-six books were written in this way by ordinary men\n\n\"(HL Hastings, Will the Old Book Stand? p.19.)"
