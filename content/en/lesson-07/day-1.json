  "sabbathIntro": "",
  "memoryVerse": "But the Lord is the true God; He is the living God and the everlasting King. At His wrath the earth will tremble, and the nations will not be able to endure His indignation. Jeremiah 10:10 (NKJV)",
  "fundamentalBelief": "There is one God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, a unity of three coeternal Persons.\nGod is immortal, all-powerful, all-knowing, above all, and ever present. He is infinite and beyond human comprehension, yet known through His self-revelation.\nGod, who is love, is forever worthy of worship, adoration, and service by the whole creation.\n\n(Gen. 1:26; Deut. 6:4; Isa. 6:8; Matt. 28:19; John 3:16; 2 Cor. 1:21, 22; 13:14; Eph. 4:4-6; 1 Peter 1:2)",
  "keyThought": "To show that there is only one true God and that He is not like any image made by man.",
  "introduction": "Everyone has within himself the instinct to worship. Man is conscious of his own limitations and recognises a higher power. Throughout the ages, the human race has lost the knowledge of the one true God and the consequence is that they ignorantly worship man-made gods. But these have never been able to help them. The creator is the only true, powerful and everlasting God.",
