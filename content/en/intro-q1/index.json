  "title": "Introduction to the First Quarter's Lessons",
"content": "It is essential for those who wish to become members of the Church to study the Bible. This must be done in order to understand its fundamental teachings. This series of 52 lessons is planned in order to help you do so.\nSeventh-day Adventists are known as *\"the people of the Book\"*. Everyone who is preparing for membership in the Church should love the word of God and determine to follow its teachings. Moreover, a study of the Bible brings many blessings:\n - There is nothing more calculated to energize the mind and strengthen the intellect than the study of the word of God.\" (EG White, Gospel Workers, p.249.)\n - If God's word were studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of mind, a mobility of character, and a stability of purpose rarely seen in these times.\" (EG White, Steps to Christ, p..90.)\n -  \"As they feed upon His word, they find that it is spirit and life. The word destroys the natural, earthly nature, and imparts a new life in Christ Jesus.\" (EG White, The Desire of Ages, p.391.)\n  -  \"As our physical life is sustained by food, so our spiritual life is sustained by the word of God. And every soul is to receive life from God's word for himself.\" (EG White, The Desire of Ages, p.390.)\nBecause the Church believes that \"No man, woman or youth can attain to Christian perfection and neglect the study of the word of God\" (EG White, Counsels on Sabbath School Work, p.17.), these lessons have been prepared to assist you.\n\nTo get the greatest benefit from these lessons, you need a Bible, so that personal study of God's word can be undertaken every day. When you attend the weekly Sabbath class, you will be well prepared to participate in discussions of the lessons with other class members.\n\nGod's word teaches us that the things of the Spirit of God are spiritually discerned (1 Corinthians 2:14). Men need spiritual help in understanding the Bible. It is a good practice, therefore, to bow your head and ask for divine guidance before commencing its study.\n\nLearn the memory verse given at the beginning of each lesson - it contains a very important thought. Review the memory verses often so that you do not forget them, and so that you can live out what they teach. Pay attention to the aim of each lesson, and seek to fulfil it as you work through the questions of the lessons.\n\nThis quarter's lessons are fundamental - they lead us to the very beginning of all things: \"In the beginning God...\" (Genesis 1:1). If you understand these important subjects, you will have a foundation for all other instruction from God's word"
