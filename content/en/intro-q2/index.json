  "title": "Introduction to the Second Quarter's Lessons",
"content": "This quarter's lessons deal with the fundamentals of a Christian life, such as repentence, confession, forgiveness, the new birth, and obedience.\n\n   \"You should study these subjects very carefully, and then meditate about each of them so that these fundamentals become part of your own life. If you have surrendered everything to Jesus and He lives within you, all of these experiences will be well known to you. Without Him, you will have no part in the great experience of salvation.\"\n\n  \"There are also other subjects from the distinctive teachings of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Theseare the testing truths that will separate God's true people from those who merely profess to believe the teachings of the word\n\n  -   \"As they feed upon His word, they find that it is spirit and life. The word destroys the natural, earthly nature, and imparts a new life in Christ Jesus.\" (EG White, The Desire of Ages, p.391.)\n  -   \"As our physical life is sustained by food, so our spiritual life is sustained by the word of God. And every soul is to receive life from God's word for himself.\" (EG White, The Desire of Ages, p.390.)    Because the Church believes that \"No man, woman or youth can attain to Christian perfection and neglect the study of the word of God\" (EG White, Counsels on Sabbath School Work, p.17.), these lessons have been prepared to assist you. To get the greatest benefit from these lessons, you need a Bible, so that personal study of God's word can be undertaken every day. When you attend the weekly Sabbath class, you will be well prepared to participate in discussions of the lessons with other class members.\n God's word teaches us that the things of the Spirit of God are spiritually discerned (1 Corinthians 2:14). Men need spiritual help in understanding the Bible. It is a good practice, therefore, to bow your head and ask for divine guidance before commencing its study.   Learn the memory verse given at the beginning of each lesson - it contains a very important thought. Review the memory verses often so that you do not forget them, and so that you can live out what they teach. Pay attention to the aim of each lesson, and seek to fulfil it as you work through the questions of the lessons.\nThis quarter's lessons are fundamental - they lead us to the very beginning of all things: \"In the beginning God...\" (Genesis 1:1). If you understand these important subjects, you will have a foundation for all other instruction from God's word."
