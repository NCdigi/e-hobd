      "authorNote": "“The wicked are to be utterly destroyed, consumed away into smoke, brought to ashes. Having inseparably allied themselves with sin, they have forfeited the right to life and an immortal existence and chosen the way of death and destruction. For this reason, they are compared to chaff, briers, thorns, and so on. Their destruction will consequently be no real loss. They will themselves have lost their opportunity to obtain eternal life and their destruction will be an act of love and mercy on the part of God. There will be nothing of value lost; nothing will be lost that is worth saving."
