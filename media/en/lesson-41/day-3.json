  "\"The government under which Jesus lived was corrupt and oppressive; on every hand were crying abuses, --extortion, intolerance, and grinding cruelty. Yet the Saviour attempted no civil reforms. He attacked no nationalabuses, nor condemned the national enemies. He did not interfere with the authority or administration of those in power. He who was our example kept aloof from earthly governments\" (DA 509)"
