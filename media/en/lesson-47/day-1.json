  "fundamentalBelief": "The Scriptures testify that one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit is prophecy.\n\n This gift is an identifying mark of the remnant church and we believe it was manifested in the ministry of Ellen G. White. Her writings speak with prophetic authority and provide comfort, guidance, instruction, and correction to the church.\n\n They also make clear that the Bible is the standard by which all teaching and experience must be tested.\n\n (Num. 12:6; 2 Chron. 20:20; Amos 3:7; Joel 2:28, 29; Acts 2:14-21; 2 Tim. 3:16, 17; Heb. 1:1-3; Rev. 12:17; 19:10; 22:8, 9.)",
"keyThought": "To understand the place of the spirit of prophecy in the church, past and present.",
  "introduction": "One of the main gifts of the Holy Spirit to the church is the gift of prophecy, sometimes called the “spirit of prophecy”. It is one of God’s appointed ways of communicating with men. The spirit of prophecy will be found in God’s church until Jesus comes again.",
